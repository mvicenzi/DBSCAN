# DBSCAN
Simple C++ implementation of DBSCAN for n-th dimensional points.

NB: This is still a work in progress and needs testing!!

##To-do list
* check DBSCAN:ComputeDistance on test points
* check DBSCAN cluster output on test set 
** create test set (and folder!)
* get DBSCAN parameters from command line like input filename
* find a way to output/display the clusters
